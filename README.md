# CU-Personal-Blog
Personal Blog Project for Columbia University Full Stack Course by Henry Kim

## Description

Module 4 utilized the basic formatting for HTML/CSS to create a similar website while utilizing API's and JS to store information within the "personal-blog posts". By creating two html pages, I created a JS function to move from one to another (submit form/blog) while also creating a light/dark js function which heavily originated and was influenced by a practice module example in the CU-modules in class. There are definite ways to simplify and optimize both css and js functions, and I tried my best. (When I tried to simplify a lot, the website basically nuked itself and I couldn't get any format sustained).

## Developer-Notes

Color theme might not be exact with the example picture shown in the module. Light/Dark JS however does function properly.

I also do not have a portfolio as Module 2 for me was skipped due to a 13-hr flight. I wanted to inform that I have linked my Github/Linkedin however to substitute for it.

## User Story

AS A marketing student. I WANT a personal blog,
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.

WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.

WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.

WHEN I enter try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.

WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.

WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.

WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.

WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.

WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.

WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.

WHEN I view the footer,
THEN I am presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
